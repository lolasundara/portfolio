title: "PLAYSTATION 5"
category: "[Campaign]"
details: "Playstation has long focused on adventure as their brand and I wanted to keep that consistency. I approached this by demonstrating and marketing the following campaign by using an adventure appeal. Most people who game often play in order to occupy or entertain themselves outside of this world. Some might even call it a getaway, which is likely to connect us to an experience. This campaign encourages people to join PS's brands club and enable them to experience something exciting, yet new. The slogan for this campaign surrounds the statement 'So Real, it's Unreal'. The project includes one concept of 3 variations; a poster, a bus advertisement, and a web banner.

exploration-text: "For this project I explored by conducting market research and diving right into Adobe Illustrator to mock up some ideas. Sometimes I like to let the creativity flow without any real structure or firm process."
