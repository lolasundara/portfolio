details: "A local and organic mud mask brand focused towards both Men and Women. The logo was produced from the brand’s initials “BM”. Together the letters form an abstract visual image of two females. In another perspective, the initials also display a masculine face, where the horizontal “B” resembles a set of eyes, and the “M” acts as the mouth."
